## How it will work

Safeguard Alert App is engineered around a user-centric approach, prioritizing ease of use during critical moments. Upon registration via Firebase, users are prompted to store up to nine emergency contacts. In potentially dangerous situations, a simple shake of their device activates an immediate SMS alert, dispatched to these saved contacts, containing the user's last known GPS location. Moreover, the SOS voice alert functionality can be triggered, serving as a potent auditory signal for nearby assistance. For times when discreetness is paramount, the app introduces the 'Panic Button' - a silent distress signal. When pressed, this button silently sends the user's location to their emergency contacts, ensuring help can be dispatched without alerting potential threats nearby.
Taking a step beyond immediate response, the app also emphasizes the importance of preparedness and knowledge. It offers users an insightful section on women's rights and basic self-defence techniques, ensuring they are not just equipped to react but also to empower themselves proactively. In its essence, 'Safeguard Alert App' stands as both a guardian and a guide, ensuring safety and imparting knowledge simultaneously.
In a recent update to our Safeguard Alert App, we've introduced an innovative feature. Now, users can discreetly capture snapshots by simply pressing the volume down button, and these images are instantly shared via WhatsApp. This added capability enhances user safety by providing a visual record of the surroundings during critical moments, further strengthening the app's commitment to comprehensive protection and empowerment."
