        <item>Child marriage takes away a girlâ€™s right to safe and healthy childhood, quality and
            complete
            education that can lead to decent economic opportunities, and social and political
            empowerment.
            Pakistan has the 6th highest number of girls married before the age of 18 in the world.
            Child
            marriage is prevalent due to several reasons including deeply entrenched traditions and
            customs,
            poverty, lack of awareness and/or access to education, and lack of security.

            The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act was made effective in 2007. This act defines child
            marriage as a marriage where the groom or the bride are underage, that is, the bride is
            under 18 years of age or the boy is younger than 21 years.

            Parents trying to marry underage girls are subject to action under this law. Since the
            law makes these marriages illegal, it acts as a major deterrent.

            In Pakistan, maternity benefits for employed women are primarily governed by the West
            Pakistan Maternity Benefit Ordinance, 1958. Under this ordinance, a woman is entitled to
            a maternity leave of twelve weeks, dividing it as six weeks before and six weeks after
            childbirth. During this period, she is to receive her full pay based on her last drawn
            wages. The law ensures her job security by prohibiting her dismissal during her
            maternity
            leave. In cases of miscarriage or medical termination of pregnancy, the ordinance grants
            her a leave of six weeks with pay, contingent on presenting relevant medical proof.
            Additionally, if complications or illnesses arise out of pregnancy or delivery, she\'s
            entitled to an added month of paid leave. While this ordinance sets the national
            baseline,
            it\'s essential to recognize that provincial laws in Pakistan might offer additional
            provisions or modifications concerning maternity benefits.

            Fasad-fil-arz, a concept used to decide severity of punishment awarded, including the
            offender s past convictions, extreme nature of the offence, and the offender being a
            danger to the community, now includes offences committed in the name of honour. The
            application of this concept automatically gives rise to severe punishments for honour
            crimes.

            Murder committed in the name of honour is punishable with death or imprisonment for
            life.

            For murder committed in the name of honour, even if the accused is pardoned by the Wali
            or other family members of the victim, the Court will still punish the accused with
            imprisonment for life.

            The Family Courts Act, 1964, in Pakistan is designed to streamline the adjudication of
            family matters, including marriage, divorce, child custody, and maintenance. Through
            this act, specialized Family Courts were established to ensure expeditious resolution of
            family disputes, providing a more focused and efficient avenue for individuals to seek
            justice in matters of personal and familial importance. This legal mechanism aims to
            address family-related issues with greater sensitivity and understanding than regular
            courts.
